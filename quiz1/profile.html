        <div class="meaning">
          <p>Hi! I’m Naufal, an Informatics Engineering student who loves solving problems and 
            creating things that make life a little easier. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by
            how technology works and how it can help people in everyday life.</p>
          <p>I enjoy working on projects that let me code, design, and experiment all at the same time. 
            One of my favorite experiences was years ago when someone messaged me to create an Instagram post. 
            That small project sparked my passion for graphic design, and today I love contributing as a designer in events, 
            combining creativity with practical solutions.</p>
          <p>Beyond technology, I make sure to enjoy life in other ways too. Watching movies or series is 
            something I try to do every day, it’s a small ritual that sparks my imagination. I also enjoy 
            swimming, which helps me relax and stay active. These hobbies give me a balance between work,
            creativity, and personal time, keeping me energized for whatever comes next.</p>
          <p>In everything I do, I try to combine curiosity, creativity, and persistence. I’m always eager
            to learn, explore new ideas, and take on challenges that help me grow—both as a student and as
              a person.</p>
